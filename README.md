# Mental-Health-in-Tech-industry

### Goal
In the past year awareness of the relationship between workplace and mental health has increased a lot, much attention has been drawn to the IT industry as employees in this field are at bigger risk of burn-out and other mental problems. In this project I was analysing surveys data from Open Source Mental Illness (OSMI). Each survey measures attitudes toward mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech industry. The purpose of this project was to prepare suggestions, which would improve well-being of personnel, for tech industry companies by analysing the provided data.
